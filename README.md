<p>I’m a <b>proactive frontend developer</b>, and soon-to-be **fullstack developer**, who once spent hours exploring beautiful websites — wondering how they were made. I was always curious about what happened behind the scenes — how developers wrote code, how transitions felt so smooth, and how layouts adapted perfectly to every screen.

That curiosity turned into passion. Now, I’m building the kinds of websites I used to admire — with clean UI, responsive design, and thoughtful interactions.
